### Console-based investigation-like game where the player must gather information from clues and witness testimony and arrest the killer.

Overview of all of the classes and snippet of the Game class

Room class that sets up the room object base

## Cipher Decoder/Encoder
### A small program that allows you to code and decode messages by using an inverse alphabet.

Game class that is essentially just the main user interface.

Coder class that encodes or decodes the users input 
The way this works is that it takes the input and converts it to numbers based on the Alphabet string, compares those numbers to the Substitute string and outputs them as text, and does the inverse for the decoder method.

## Songwriter
### An attempt at using code to generate the song Rattlin' Bog, without just explicitly writing it out.

Main method used to construct the song.

Establishing lyrics and phrases

The starting line and second lines are different than the song lyrics, so I had to print them manually.
This song was kind of annoying as many lines didn't repeat as they did the first time. I really wish I did the simple version as I probably would have gotten more points for an easier workload. :/

## Tip Calculator
### A simple program that generates a tip amount based on their inputted bill amount and how much percent they'd like to tip by.

Main method

Calculator method that ensures that the bill and/or tip aren't zero, then returns the tip amount
Calculators are easy because Visual Studio already has calculations built into it. I can't imagine how I would program multiplication.

## Adopt-A-Robot Refactoring
### Code that we were tasked with refactoring, aka splitting into multiple parts.

This code was simple to refactor as it was already well split up.
